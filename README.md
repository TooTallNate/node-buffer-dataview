buffer-dataview
===============
### Minimal DataView implementation that works with Node.js Buffers

This module provides a very minimal [DataView][] implementation. Node.js already
comes with a DataView implementation, but it only works with `ArrayBuffer`
instances, and not Node's preferred `Buffer` type. This is mostly useful when
re-using previously written code which interacts with `DataView` instances
rather than Node.js Buffers.

The `DataView` instances simply proxy the invoked instance method to the
equivalent [Buffer API][] call.

Note that the `buffer` property of the `DataView` instance is the Node.js `Buffer`
instance, and _not_ a converted `ArrayBuffer` or something else like that. There's
no copying that happens here, it's just a "view"...

Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install buffer-dataview
```


Example
-------

``` js
var DataView = require('buffer-dataview');

var buffer = new Buffer(4);
var view = new DataView(buffer);

// set a "float" in the data view
view.setFloat32(0, 1337.1234, true);

// ensure that the original Buffer was modified
console.log(buffer.readFloatLE(0));
// â†’ 1337.1234130859375
```
